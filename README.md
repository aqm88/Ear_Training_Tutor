## How To Install

**RECOMMENDED:** 
Download and install the release version [here](https://github.com/aqm88/Ear_Training_Tutor/releases/latest)

If you are on Windows download the .exe and click to install.

If you are on Mac download the zip and run ear_training_tutor.app (this should work for both intel and arm mac's but I haven't been able to test).

If you are using ubuntu, download the .deb file and install it on your system (you're using linux, I trust that you know how to install a .deb file on your own).

If you are using another variety of linux download the rpm file and install it (what I said above about linux users also applies to you)

## For Development Purposes

If you really want to run it in dev mode you will need to do the following.

run this command in the root folder (i.e. Ear_Training_Tutor)
```
npm install
```
then do the following
```
cd ear_training_tutor
```
then run this command
```
npm install
```
then finally you can run the code using the following command
```
npm run dev
```
