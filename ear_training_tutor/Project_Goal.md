# AI-Powered Ear Training Tutor

Ear training is a fundamental skill for musicians, enabling them to recognize musical notes, intervals, and keys by listening rather than relying on sheet music or an instrument. However, many learners struggle to develop this skill due to a lack of structured practice, personalized feedback, and adaptive learning paths. Traditional ear training methods—such as listening to static exercises or practicing with a teacher—often fail to adapt to the learner’s specific weaknesses and progression speed.

This project aims to solve this issue by developing an **AI-powered ear training tutor** that presents interactive listening exercises and adapts to the user’s performance to create a personalized learning experience. The system will play notes through the computer and require users to respond using an interactive virtual music sheet or other selection methods, rather than having them perform notes through a microphone. This eliminates barriers related to instrument access and ensures a controlled learning environment.

## Learning Objectives

The AI tutor will help learners develop the following key aural skills:

- **Note Recognition** – Identifying individual musical notes when played in isolation.
- **Interval Recognition** – Recognizing the pitch distance between two notes and classifying them as major/minor seconds, thirds, perfect fifths, etc.
- **Chord and Key Identification** – Determining whether a set of notes belongs to a specific chord or musical key (e.g., major, minor, diminished, augmented).
- **Relative Pitch Training** – Training the ear to understand the relationship between notes, improving a musician’s ability to play by ear and transcribe music.
- **Progressive Learning Adaptation** – Adjusting the difficulty of exercises dynamically based on user performance to ensure an optimal challenge level.

By training these skills, learners will strengthen their aural perception, improving their ability to recognize melodies, harmonies, and tonal structures—an essential skill for musicians, composers, and music students.

## How the AI Tutor Will Support Learning

This AI-powered tutor will provide structured, interactive support through multiple intelligent features:

- **Computer-Generated Note Exercises**:  
  The system will play a single note, a set of notes, or an interval, and the user will identify the correct answer by selecting from a virtual music sheet or an on-screen keyboard.

- **Adaptive Difficulty Levels**:  
  The system will track the user’s accuracy and adjust the difficulty dynamically. If the learner excels at recognizing single notes, the system will introduce intervals; if they master intervals, it will present full chords and key identification exercises.

- **Real-Time Feedback and Explanations**:  
  After each response, the system will provide immediate feedback, highlighting whether the answer was correct and offering explanations or hints to reinforce learning.

- **Error Pattern Analysis**:  
  The AI will analyze incorrect answers to detect patterns in mistakes (e.g., consistently confusing perfect fifths with octaves) and provide targeted exercises to strengthen weak areas.

- **Performance Tracking and Personalized Reports**:  
  The system will store data on each session and generate progress reports, allowing users to see their improvement over time and identify areas that need further practice.

## AI Techniques and Implementation

This project will leverage AI techniques to adapt learning exercises, provide intelligent feedback, and track user performance efficiently. The main AI-driven components include:

- **Adaptive Learning Models** –  
  A reinforcement learning algorithm or Bayesian knowledge tracing model will be used to adjust difficulty based on user performance, ensuring an optimal challenge level.

- **Intelligent Feedback System** –  
  Using Natural Language Processing (NLP), the system will provide tailored feedback and hints based on the user’s responses. For example, if a user frequently misidentifies minor thirds as major thirds, the AI might explain the tonal difference and suggest listening exercises.

- **Interval and Key Recognition Algorithm** –  
  A pre-trained neural network will classify sets of notes and determine their musical key or interval structure, allowing the system to dynamically create appropriate exercises.

- **User Data Analytics and Performance Insights** –  
  The AI will track user accuracy over time, identifying common mistakes and generating personalized practice recommendations based on statistical trends in the learner’s responses.
